title: About
---

I am a Senior Data Scientist at Twitter working on their analytics team. I have always been fascinated by technology and especially tools for analysing and interpreting information. I want to use this website to help teach people new skills. Recently, I have written about Jekyll and Apache Pig.

Before working at Twitter, I was a Data Science Fellow at the Insight Data Science Fellowship. Before that, I got a PhD in physics from Stanford University studying pulsar wind Nebulae. I have written about my PhD research experience here, and software I helped develop during my PhD here.

Before that, I was an undergraduate at Marlboro College in Vermont. I wrote about my undergraduate research here, as well as my research during two undergraduate physics internships here, and here.
