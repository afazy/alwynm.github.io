Git is a distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. Best known git as service are probably [GitHub](http://github.com/) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), but many others are available, like GitLab, GerritForge, etc. 

Copy git repository to local
{% highlight js %}git clone <url>
{% endhighlight %}

Create a new local repository
{% highlight js %}git init
{% endhighlight %}

Add one or more files to staging
{% highlight js %}git add <filename>
git add *
{% endhighlight %}

Commit changes to head (but not yet to the remote repository)
{% highlight js %}git commit -m "Commit message"
{% endhighlight %}

Send changes to the master branch of your remote repository
{% highlight js %}git push origin master
{% endhighlight %}

Will apply all your yet-to-be-pushed commits on top of the remote tree commits allowing your commits to be straight in a row and without branches
{% highlight js %}git pull --rebase origin master
{% endhighlight %}

List the files you've changed and those you still need to add or commit
{% highlight js %}git status
{% endhighlight %}

Take your uncommitted changes (both staged and unstaged), saves them away for later use
{% highlight js %}git stash
{% endhighlight %}

Throws away the (topmost, by default) stash after applying it
{% highlight js %}git stash pop
{% endhighlight %}

Create a new branch and switch to it
{% highlight js %}git checkout -b <branchname>
{% endhighlight %}

Switch from one branch to another
{% highlight js %}git checkout <branchname>
{% endhighlight %}

List all the branches in your repo, and also tell you what branch you're currently in
{% highlight js %}git branch
{% endhighlight %}

Delete the feature branch
{% highlight js %}git branch -d <branchname>
{% endhighlight %}

Push the branch to your remote repository, so others can use it
{% highlight js %}git push origin <branchname>
{% endhighlight %}

Delete a branch on your remote repository
{% highlight js %}git push origin :<branchname>
{% endhighlight %}

Fetch and merge changes on the remote server to your working directory
{% highlight js %}git pull origin <branchname>
{% endhighlight %}
