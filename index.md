I'm a PhD student in Computer Science & Engineering at
[IIT Patna](https://www.iitp.ac.in) under the supervision of 
[Dr. Jimson Mathew](https://www.iitp.ac.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1502%3Adr-jimson-mathew&catid=49&Itemid=77). 
I'm primarily interested in replicating biological visual system 
to a computer system. My current research goal is to build 
learning algorithms that can perceive depth without supervision.
