I'm a PhD student at IIT Patna under the supervision of [Dr. Jimson Mathew](https://www.iitp.ac.in/index.php/departments/engineering/computer-science-a-engineering/people/faculty/1502-dr-jimson-mathew.html). I'm primarily interested in replicating biological visual system to a computer system. My current research goal is to build learning algorithms that can perceive depth in a unsupervised way.
